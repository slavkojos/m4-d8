Netflix, Navigation
In this exercise you'll apply your new knowledge about react-router-dom. Remember to install the package from npm (npm i react-router-dom).
Netflix App - React Router
Create a Route for a ShowDetail component. It should be able to receive a ID parameter from the querystring.
Create the ShowDetail component that receives from the url the ID parameter and fetches all the informations about the movie (from omdb & comments too).
Make every Show (Movie or Series) clickable and create an onClick redirect to the ShowDetail route.
From the main component pass also a prop called 'title' to every other component wrapped inside a Route, and use it for displaying inside of it the title of that section (in an "h1").
EXTRA
Add a Link for TV Shows in the Navbar to navigate to a TV Shows component.
Pass a route parameter named "series" in the TV Shows component route and use it for querying APIs like: ?s={series}&type={series}.
Display results accordingly, and link every show in the result with its detail page.
Polish the browsing experience with loaders.

        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:

        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/

        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.

        The Comment structure is this:

        {
          "comment": "A good movie but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": 3,
          "elementId": "tt1756545"
        }

        Where:
        - comment is the comment inserted by the user
        - rate is a value between 1 and 5
        - elementId is the imdbID of the movie / serie
